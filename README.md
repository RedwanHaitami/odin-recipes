## What was learned

In this project I tried to use all the HTML and CSS knowledge that I have acquired in the foundations course:

- How to build a simple website and using Git.
- How to add HTML boilerplate and elements to the index files.
- How to link HTML index page with the main CSS file and style all with various CSS properties.</br>
