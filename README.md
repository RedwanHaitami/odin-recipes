## About this project

- This project built with semantic HTML5 markup and CSS3 custom propeties.
- It consists of a main index page about the Moroccan Tagine as a main menu with links of three recipes pages.
- Each recipe page has:
  
  - An image of the dish under `h1` heading.
  - Two paragraphs describing the recipe.
  - "Ingredients" heading, followed by an **Unordered list** of the indegredients for the recipe.
  - Under the ingredients, there is "steps" heading followed by an **Ordered list** of steps for making the dish.</br>

## What was learned

In this project I tried to use all the HTML and CSS knowledge that I have acquired in the foundations course:

- How to build a simple website and using Git.
- How to add HTML boilerplate and elements to the index files.
- How to link HTML index page with the main CSS file and style all with various CSS properties.</br>
